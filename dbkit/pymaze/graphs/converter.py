    Retrieves a set of edges from a given maze and the nodes that were extracted from the maze.

    This looks for the immediate neighbors of each node supplied to the function. In this case, it moves east and south
     in the maze, but it could just as well follow the opposite directions, remembering to change the loop indexing and
     wall detection accordingly. It uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if a border around the current square has
      either the right or bottom side, indicating a wall that terminates the search in that direction.

    On the other hand, if it finds that a square located in the same row or column as the source node is also present
    in the set of nodes, and thereâ€™s no wall between them, then it creates an Edge instance and adds it to the set of
    edges.
